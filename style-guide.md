# Undesktop Project Formatting Guide
## Code
 * Indent with tabs, align with spaces.  Where something is both indented and aligned, use them
   properly in combination.
 * For commit messages, follow [Tim Pope's guide][1] for the most part, but if you want to get
   fancy, keep it compatible with markdown.
 * Separate logic and presentation with classes and signals for communication.
