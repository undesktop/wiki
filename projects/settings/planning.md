## Other Projects' Solutions
### ElementaryOS
[ElementaryOS](http://launchpad.net/switchboard) seems to handle it via GtkPlug and an ini-format
`.plugin` file, perhaps aim for compatibility with their API?  Their
[example](https://code.launchpad.net/~xapantu/switchboard/plug-sample) is pretty easy to follow.

### GNOME3?
How does GNOME3 handle this?

### OSX?
I know this is pluggable, and Apple tends to have pretty extensive documentation.

### iOS
iirc iOS just lets you specify the menu layouts, I don't think you can actually build your own GUI.
I can ask a friend who does iOS development probably.

### Android
How does Android do this?  Does Android do this?  I honestly have no clue how Android works.

### Unity?
Does Unity's settings system even provide connections?  I've never seen a third-party settings
applet in there
